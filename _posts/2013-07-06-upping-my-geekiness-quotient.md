I think it is time to up my geekiness quotient.  I know; I'll start a blog.

I don't even really know what I blog is.  I think it is something
pretentious people do to make themselves feel smarter by writing incoherent
crap that nobody else reads.  In that case, blogging is definitely for me.
I figure this is a good place to showcase any hobby-like activities I do
and a good place for you to ignore them.  Perhaps this will also inspire me
to get my own domain name, which is something I have considered for a while
but had nowhere to point it, until now.

This first post is really just some pointless text I am using for an entry
as I set up the web site.  Later I hope to post entries with more technical
depth and even less lucid.

I end with this pointless, but strangely appropriate, quote from the movie
_Billy Madison_:
