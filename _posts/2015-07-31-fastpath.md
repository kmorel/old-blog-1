This summer our family took a vacation in southern California, and we had a
fun excursion to the [Disney theme
parks](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/). What I particularly enjoy about
Disney's parks, apart from the technically impressive rides themselves, is
the attention to detail for the whole experience from the moment you enter
the park to the time you leave. You can see little details in everything
from the escalators in the parking garage to the storefront facades to the
activities in line. And one of the most notable features is the
[Fastpass](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/guest-services/fastpass/)
option.

For those who have not yet experienced it yet, Fastpass is a free service
in the Disney parks that allows you to skip to the front of the line on
many of the popular rides. The way it works is you go to a machine and get
a ticket that tells you to come back at a certain time. When you come back
in that time window, you get to walk right up to the front of the line.

Fastpass is of course great when you are using it. But what I find really
interesting about Fastpass is that it can make your wait shorter even if
you don't use it.

Huh? How can people cutting in front of you in line make your wait shorter?
To understand that, let's back up and take a look at the general queuing
process.

## Just Make It Faster

Needless to say, Disneyland is a pretty popular place. Tens of thousands of
guests visit the parks each day, and most will want to ride each of the
major attractions. It takes time to feed all these people through the ride,
and that means we wait. So, how can the wait time be reduced?

    Like many Disneyland rides, It's a Small World has large boats
    (accommodating at least 15 people), and the loading dock is split into
    two tracks to double the speed boats can be loaded.<br />

With some brainstorming, we can think up several ways to speed up an
attraction's line. The most direct mechanism is to feed people into the
ride faster, and Disney has been a leader in designing rides that can feed
guests quickly. Most rides have larger than normal cars with lots of seats
to maximize the number of people sent each time. Every ride has multiple
cars going at the same time packed as close as possible to maintain safety.
To continually feed cars through the ride at the maximum rate, each loading
dock features mechanisms to load riders in multiple cars at the same time.
Many rides even feature a mechanism to move a car out of the queue so
something like a seat belt jam won't hold up the ride. While you are waiting
to get on, take a good look at the mechanisms. It's fascinating.

So once the ride has been designed to maximize the speed, what else can we
do? Well, you could make the wait in the line more enjoyable. The lines of
many rides feature elaborate themed decorations, animatronics, video clips,
and activities. None of these features will make the wait actually go
faster, but they will make it seem faster.

Once the ride has been designed to its extreme, what else can be done? What
if you could convince some of the guests to wait longer to allow everyone
else to get on faster?

## The Slow Lane

Let's work with an example to make things easier. Say that the [Space
Mountain](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disneyland/space-mountain/)
ride at a given time has a 1 hour wait. You are an
[imagineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering) that
wants to make the line shorter. To do so, you make a second, slower line.
For every 10 people you let on from the original line you let on 1 person
from the slow line. Clearly, if you move people from the original line to
the slow line, the original line will go even faster. You figure that if
you can convince 30% of the people to wait about 3 and a half hours in the
slow line, the people remaining in the original line would only have to
wait about 45 minutes instead of an hour.

The question is, how do you get people to agree to wait in a longer line?

<!---
33 gpm
original 60 min wait
1980 people in line
Put 594 people in fastpass (30%)
1386 people in standby (70%)
Standby wait 46.2 min @ 30 gpm
Fastpass wait 198 min = 3.3 hours
-->

<!---
33 gpm
original 40 min wait
1320 people in line
new, 30 min wait @ 30 gpm
900 people in standby
420 people in fastpass
140 min wait, 2.3 hours
-->

## Incentivizing a Longer Wait

Obviously, no one is going to choose a line with a longer wait simply to
wait longer. It is also unacceptable to force some patrons to wait longer
than others. Instead, you have to convince a significant portion of riders
to wait in the longer line.

<figure style="float:right; width:250px; padding-left:10px;">
  <img src="/images/fastpath/money.jpg" width="240" height="160" />

One obvious way to do this is to pay money to anyone agreeing to wait in
the slow line. If you offered, say $20, to anyone who chooses the slow
line, many will take you up on it. Disney, of course, choose not to do
this, but many other amusement parks do. Sort of. Many parks now offer a
premium "VIP ticket" or some equivalent that gives you expedited entry to
rides. Charging more for the fast line or giving money for the slow lane
are essentially the same although the practice of reaping added fees at the
expense of other patrons feels a bit more unpalatable.

    Why stand in line? We'll hold your place while you have a snack and
    take a nap.

But people are motivated by things other than money. What else can you
offer to convince people to wait longer? You could make the wait more
pleasurable. Rather than standing relatively still in line with nothing
else to do, what if patrons were allowed to do something else that they
were planning to do anyway? If someone agrees to wait in the slow lane, you
could offer to hold their place in line. While you hold their place, they
can go have a meal, browse the shopping areas, or visit less busy rides.

This is exactly what Disney is doing. They gave this slow line the ironic
name "Fastpass" and the original line "standby." As people decide to use
the Fastpass line, they bleed off the standby line and make the latter
actually go faster.

## Seriously, Does Fastpass Actually Make Standby Faster?

Well... although I've just shown how Fastpass can make standby faster, at
least in theory, I've ignored several behaviors that work to make the lines
longer again. Most importantly, Fastpass owners are not going to sit around
the park. Rather, many will spend that time waiting in other standby lines
(and vice versa) with a net effect of fewer people actually leaving the
standby lines.

Then again, some portion will never return to get on the ride. (I
personally have gotten several Fastpasses that I ended up not using for a
variety of reasons.) These are essentially people that have left the
standby line and choose never to ride at all.

Even if Fastpass is effective in reducing the standby wait time, the
shorter wait time itself will encourage more people to wait in line,
bringing the wait time up again. Line wait times probably have a tendency
to balance themselves out.

Ultimately all this means that more people will be able to enjoy their ride
experience. You have to appreciate what a clever system this is to give
patrons a chance to experience short wait times (even though the wait time
is in reality longer) without really negatively affecting other wait times.
