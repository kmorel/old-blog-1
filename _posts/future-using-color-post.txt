## How to Use Color


How many of us have to make figures for reports, presentations, or papers?
Probably anybody willing to read the technobabble on this site. Many of
these figures will incorporate color, as it can be a powerful medium for
conveying or enhancing information &mdash; when used correctly. However,
the human visual system has a complicated, nonlinear response to color so
that when used incorrectly color can serve to mislead rather than inform.

The following is based on a presentation I gave geared to a group of
students interning this summer at Sandia National Laboratories. This is a
high level introduction on what color means and how it can be effectively
used.

This post comprises to major parts. The first part gives a high level
review of the psychophysics of color and an overview of our
perceptual interpretation. The second part takes this information and
provides specific advise on how to most effectively use color to convey
information.
