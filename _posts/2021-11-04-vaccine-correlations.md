title: Strange Correlations in COVID-19 Data
category: visualization
tags: [ statistics ]
---

I recently had the pleasure to host another session of [VisLies]. As an
early demonstration of lying with visualization, I presented these 2
graphs taken from data provided by the CDC for US states.[^cdc-data-source]

<img src="/images/vaccine-correlations/vaccines_bad.svg"

	 width="48%" />
<img src="/images/vaccine-correlations/vaccines_good.svg"
     alt="Good Vaccine Plot"
	 width="48%" />

The first plot seems to suggest that more vaccinations cause more people to
die. The second plot, built from the same source data, suggests that more
vaccinations prevent deaths. They cannot both be right.

The difference is easily explained. The graph on the left measures data in
absolute numbers whereas the graph on the right measures data per capita.
Measuring data with absolute numbers is problematic. By simple proportions,
we would expect a state with a larger population to have more vaccinations
and more deaths. The difference in population between the most populous
state (California) and least populous (Wyoming) is over 65 times, which
overrides any effect from differences in vaccination. The fact that the
left graph also takes a cumulative death toll, most of which happened
before the vaccine was even available, skews the results even more.

## The Paper

</a>

But that's not what I really want to talk about in this blog. Soon after I
presented the above images, Pat Crossno pointed out a paper she had found
recently with a similar theme. The paper is titled [Increases in COVID-19
are unrelated to levels of vaccination across 68 countries and 2947
counties in the United States] and was published in the _European Journal
of Epidemiology_. In particular, the article has the image shown at right.

What is strange about this plot is that it seems to show the opposite of
the plot I presented earlier. It shows the vaccination rate correlated with
a _higher_ infection rate. Unlike the poor visualization example I gave at
the beginning at this blog, the values on both axes are given per capita,
so the difference is not explained by a correlation with population.

So what gives? Let's dive deeper.

## Replication

As a first step, let's replicate what was done in the paper. Fortunately,
the paper is using a public data source that is freely available to
everyone. It is using the [Our World in Data COVID-19 data]. The paper
takes data from August 28, 2021 to September 3, 2021.

To replicate these results, I pulled [the data on October 30, 2021]. I also
filtered my data to the week between August 28 to September 3. It should be
noted that because I pulled the data at a later date than was done for the
paper, it contains more entries in the week we are analyzing because there
can be a long delay for the reporting. Because it contains more complete
data, I will use it here.[^owid-data-source]

<a href="/images/vaccine-correlations/vaccinated-vs-cases.svg">
  <img src="/images/vaccine-correlations/vaccinated-vs-cases.svg"
       alt="Vaccinated vs. Cases"
	   style="float:right; padding:10px;" />
</a>

So, after filtering the data down to valid data for the week in question,
we get this plot at right. The basic characteristics of these two plots are
the same. They both show a linear regression in the positive direction.
Israel, labeled in each plot, stands as a particular outlier in both plots.

The plot I replicated does have more points, and many of the points have
larger values. In the plot here, the Israel outlier is joined by another
measurement (it happens to be Mongolia). This difference is likely due to
taking the data at a later time. Some of the positive tests taken in this
week were reported after the paper was written. Nevertheless, the new data
does not significantly skew the outcome.

## Alternate Hypothesis

The paper concludes from this graph that increased vaccination does not
reduce and in fact may increase infection rates. I propose an alternate
hypothesis: the correlation we are seeing is more influenced by the amount
of tests given than the amount of infections that actually occur.

This hypothesis is based on the observation that the cases in the data
cover only positive tests. A person who gets COVID-19 but is not tested
will not be counted in this database. It does not take [a genius to surmise
that more COVID-19 tests can lead to more measured "COVID-19 cases"].

<a href="/images/vaccine-correlations/tests-vs-cases.svg">
  <img src="/images/vaccine-correlations/tests-vs-cases.svg"
       alt="Tests vs. Cases"
	   style="float:right; padding:10px;" />
</a>

Fortunately, this same data set contains information about the number of
tests administered. The plot at right shows the correlation. Although there
are other factors at play here, we can see that there is some correlation
between testing and positive tests.

The second part of the hypothesis is the idea that a the number of vaccines
administered is correlated with the number of tests given. This would make
sense as a country with the wherewithal and desire to vaccinate a high
proportion of people are also those that are more willing and able to
administer more tests.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<a href="/images/vaccine-correlations/vaccinated-vs-tests.svg">
  <img src="/images/vaccine-correlations/vaccinated-vs-tests.svg"
       alt="Vaccinated vs. Tests"
	   style="float:right; padding:10px;" />
</a>

We can easily verify this in the data. Here is a plot demonstrating the
correlation between the number of people vaccinated and the number of tests
administered. Apart from a few outliers, countries that vaccinate more tend
to test more.

So with this new evidence, the relationship between vaccination and the
actual infection rate is less clear. Much of the case rate can be explained
by simple testing rate.

## Conclusion

To be fair, [the paper][Increases in COVID-19 are unrelated to levels of
vaccination across 68 countries and 2947 counties in the United States] is
not using this data to make claims about vaccine efficacy (as I was
claiming at the beginning of this blog). Rather, the paper is attempting to
correlate vaccines to the _infection rate_ of the virus. These are not the
same thing.

Although counterintuitive, it is conceivable  that the infection rate might
not be negatively  correlated with vaccination rate even  with an effective
vaccine. Perhaps  a vaccine breakthrough case  is likely to spread to more
people because [the symptoms tend to be more mild] and therefore the person
is  likely  to  spend  more   time  in  public  while  infective.[^perhaps]
Furthermore, vaccinated  individuals might  be inclined  to relax  mask and
social distancing  precautions (which  tends to  be encouraged  by [current
recommendations] and policies).

But I contend in this blog post that the data used for this study does not
actually demonstrate a correlation between vaccination and infection (or
lack thereof). Rather, any correlation in the data is between vaccination
rates and COVID-19 _detection_ rates, which is really driven by the
correlation between the number of vaccines given and the number of tests
done. Of course, neither have I demonstrated any correlation between
vaccines and infection. Ultimately, this data is too incomplete to draw
such conclusions.
