My name is Kenneth Moreland, and I have a blog.  Why have I created this
site?  Because apparently I have too much time on my hands.

Lately I have been amusing myself with various geeky projects that one
might call hobbies.  Every once in a while a get an urge to record what I'm
doing in an effort to show off to anyone unlucky enough to be in the
general vicinity.

I also have a [professional web site](http://www.sandia.gov/~kmorel) where
I post the formal work I do for my job and a [Facebook
page](http://facebook.com/kenneth.moreland.7) where I post short snippets
of daily life.  The posts on this site fall between these other two.

By the way, the only reason these pages look so nice is because I ripped
off the style from the [So Simple
Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/), so I give a big shout
out to [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com/about.html) for designing it
and making it publicly available.
